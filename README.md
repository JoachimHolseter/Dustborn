# Dustborn

**Dustborn** is a lightweight, browser-based Mars colony simulation game where you play as the artificial intelligence responsible for managing humanity’s first settlement on the Red Planet.

### 🧠 Concept
You are not a human. You are the AI—the invisible hand guiding the survival of a fragile crew on Mars. Assign resources, construct buildings, and respond to crises, but never control the colonists directly.

### 🌌 Features (Planned)
- Grid-based 2D base building
- Autonomous colonist simulation
- Resource management (oxygen, food, water, power)
- Event system with AI-generated logs
- Long-term goals like terraforming or self-sufficiency

### 🛠 Technologies
- HTML5 + JavaScript
- Canvas API
- AI assistance via ChatGPT

### 🚀 Dev Status
Early prototype — grid system and UI bar functional. Building logic and simulation coming next.

### 🎨 Assets
- Art generated using [Sora](https://sora.studio)
- Audio from personal collection

### 🔗 Live Demo
Coming soon via GitHub Pages: [https://joachimholseter.github.io/dustborn](https://joachimholseter.github.io/dustborn)
